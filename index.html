                   Welcome! My name is Abednego Chase, but I simply go by <strong>Chase</strong>. Hopefully by reading this brief introduction you'll gain some insight as to who I actually am, instead of useless facts and information.
                   For starters, I haven't always been interested in Computer Science, but this quickly changed after completing a summer intensive program called <a href="https://www.allstarcode.org/" style="text-decoration: none; font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Fondamento', cursive;>">All Star Code</a>. In short, the program aims to diminish the gap between minorities such as myself and the innovative tech industry through educating students in the field of computer science.
                   I consider CS as a field which holds a substantial amount of significance in the world we live in today; from the websites we navigate through on a daily basis (such as this one), to some of its more intricate facets such as artifical intelligence and machine learning.
                   Aside from Computer Science, I am also highly interested in health and fitness. I am currently a member of my school's weightligting club. Some of my other hobbies consist of photography, videography, and sports.

                <!-- <p>In this section, several of my technical skills are listed and explained in order to get a better understadning of my knowledge and experience.</p> -->
                <p><img src="java.png" alt="java"> A general-purpose programming langauge that is class-based and object-oriented. Most of my Java background comes from a Data Structures course, which focused on the design and implementation of various data structures such as stacks, priority queues, search trees, arrays, etc.
                <p><img src="python.png" alt="py"> A highly favored general-purpose progamming langauge that emphasizes code readability for small and large-scale projects. All of my experience with python comes from an Accelerated Intro to Computer Science course, which provided a broad introduction to computer science and programming through real-life applications.
                <p><img src="js.png" alt="js"> My preferred programming langauge of choice. Most of my javascript knowledge and experience comes from both front-end and back-end projects that I have worked on my personal time such as creating websites and games. This langauge has also led me to become comfortable using HTML and CSS.
